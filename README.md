DIY SOCCER GOAL

I built this soccer goal to be 16x8x4ft it is regulation height but not width. It was a fun project and ended up working quite well. It was made out of Eight 2inX4inX8ft boards four
metal braces to connect some of the eight foot boards to get 16 ft. For attaching the boards together I used 2 1/2 inch screws and for the braces I used 1 inch screws.

Here is the final product:
